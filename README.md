What did you build?
I built a playable basketball game where you try and make the ball into the hoop as many times in a minute.

What language(s) or tools did you use?
The languages I used are HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

Which AI tools did you use, and how?
I used Cursor ai to evolve my code by adding multiple features I am not able to do.

What did you do versus what AI helped with?
I wrote the base code and made it a template to add more things. I wrote the code for some of the html and for the movement for the ball and player. AI then made my code more complex while adding features such as time.

What’s one thing you’re proud of?
I am proud I was able to make a game this complex eventhough AI was a huge part of it.

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
I would like to add more game modes and features to make the game even more fun and complex.
